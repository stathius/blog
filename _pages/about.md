PhD student at Imperial College London. I am interested in the intersection of Machine Learning and Physics. Focusing on extracting meaningful representations and causality in dynamical systems.


I did my undergraduate in Physics at the University of Ioannina, Greece. I also hold another bachelors in Computer Science from the same university where I graduated first of my class. I got the MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh with distiction. My previous research experience includes working at MedLab a bionformatics lab at the University of Ioannina and RobCib a robotics research lab at the Polytechnic University of Madrid. I also have industry experience as a software engineer and data scientist.
