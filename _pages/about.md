PhD student at Imperial College London. I am interested in the intersection of Machine Learning and Physics. Focusing on extracting meaningful representations and causality in dynamical systems.


My first undergraduate was in Physics at the University of Ioannina, Greece. I also hold another BSc in Computer Science from the same university where I graduated first of my class. I finished the MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh with Distiction. My previous research experience includes MedLab, a bionformatics lab at the University of Ioannina, and RobCib, a robotics research lab at the Polytechnic University of Madrid. I have worked in the industry mainly as a data scientist and software engineer.
